This book is similar to meditation, a beautiful little\n                coloring book about being selfish and optimistic (and how that\n                can be a really good thing). Like into meditation, the act of\n                coloring explores a variety of themes, and there are plenty of\n                ideas that could be useful for you and others.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                To kick things off, we have a simple one about the most\n                universal human skill: perspective-taking. We need to empty our\n                brains in order to focus on the really important things in life.\n                Go forth and experience the value of applying and breaking free\n                of our habitual ways!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                <strong>Here&#39;s a funny one:</strong>I used to be pretty much\n                the stereotype of an introvert. I was the kind of person who\n                didn&#39;t like crowds, was clumsy and small and weirdly timid\n                (okay, pretty &quot;funny&quot; in the sense of laugh out loud\n                funny). I still do those things (although I get better at them).\n                But my new perspective is that I&#39;m actually a very\n                intelligent person that deserves the best in life. Coloring\n                books are helping to calm down and restore my balance. They are\n                a wonderful distraction from my problems and bring my mind to\n                things I really want to think about.
