                Mandala coloring pages help promote clarity in concentration and
                restore balance and mindfulness. If you like coloring,
                you&#39;ll appreciate a Mandala coloring book. Like the physical
                mandalas, the illustrations are done using natural hand motions
                to facilitate ease of memorization.

                Indo-Asian Art helps you get started in the art of making art,
                and as you practice, you will find the patterns clear and
                simple. It is a way that non-artists can understand too because
                of its purity. Mandalas come in a variety of styles and shapes.
                The Asian art takes a very different approach because their goal
                is to express the innate virtues of enlightenment. The doors of
                enlightenment are opened through both physical and mental
                activities.
