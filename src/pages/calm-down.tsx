                A super relaxing and heartfelt coloring book about getting your
                shit together in order to have a happier future! This book is
                similar to meditation, a beautiful little coloring book about
                being selfish and optimistic (and how that can be a really good
                thing). Like into meditation, the act of coloring explores a
                variety of themes, and there are plenty of ideas that could be
                useful for you and others.

                To kick things off, we have a simple one about the most
                universal human skill: perspective-taking. We need to empty our
                brains in order to focus on the really important things in life.
                Go forth and experience the value of applying and breaking free
                of our habitual ways!

                <strong>Here&#39;s a funny one:</strong>I used to be pretty much
                the stereotype of an introvert. I was the kind of person who
                didn&#39;t like crowds, was clumsy and small and weirdly timid
                (okay, pretty &quot;funny&quot; in the sense of laugh out loud
                funny). I still do those things (although I get better at them).
                But my new perspective is that I&#39;m actually a very
                intelligent person that deserves the best in life. Coloring
                books are helping to calm down and restore my balance. They are
                a wonderful distraction from my problems and bring my mind to
                things I really want to think about. Oh, and one more thing, if
                you like coloring books, there&#39;s a free app available on
                Play Store.
