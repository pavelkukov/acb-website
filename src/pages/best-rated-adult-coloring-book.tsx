                past. The main difference is the digitalization. Now you can

                part is that all <Link to="/">coloring pages</Link> are free and

                When you start coloring for the first time, tap on the area to
                fill it with color. Another advantage of coloring this way is
                that the illustrations are likely to have a greater quality when
                printed. Whitespaces are covered completely without gaps. You
                can use stamps or crayons to enrich the illustration even
                further. The results are just beautiful.
