I still do those things (although I get better at them).\n                But my new perspective is that I&#39;m actually a very\n                intelligent person that deserves the best in life. Coloring\n                books are helping to calm down and restore my balance. They are\n                a wonderful distraction from my problems and bring my mind to\n                things I really want to think about.
