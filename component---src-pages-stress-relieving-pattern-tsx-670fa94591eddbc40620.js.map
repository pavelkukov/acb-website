All you need to get started - download and play, making\n                it ideal for adults.

Take your time and get it perfect. Be creative. The\n                pleasure comes from the act itself. And the ideas it raises for\n                you. Kids Love the process. And the color. Adults are not\n                different in nature. You will feel good.

A young woman was complaining to\n                me about her lack of inspiration for her art. I said something\n                like, &quot;What are you so frustrated about? Art isn&#39;t just\n                about the satisfaction of seeing something you&#39;ve created.\n                It&#39;s about having something you want to see. Art is a joy,\n                and it doesn&#39;t have to be a triumph. Art is something to do\n                after you&#39;ve learned how to smile at other people and play.\n            </p>\n        </Layout>\n    )\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
